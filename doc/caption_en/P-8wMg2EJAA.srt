1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:04,600
Lose weight to lose weight, the more you lose, the more fat you lose. It's not about you, you can lose weight if you want to lose weight.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,700
Are you still worrying about losing weight? Are you still worried about your weight?

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,100
Do you still want to eat but dare not eat?

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,100
Are you still turning the hula hoop? I know what you are thinking

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,300
Please keep reading. Don't worry, I'm not selling weight loss pills

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,800
I just have some weight loss experience and want to record an inner monologue about weight loss

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,200
Losing weight is not just by shouting, you have to shout every day

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,500
Countless people are doing fasting challenges. They can lose many kilograms without eating for a few days.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,000
I have to say that as long as your willpower is strong enough, how much thinner you want to lose?

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,200
But don’t forget, the ideal is full, the reality is skinny

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,200
Not many people can stick to the end, and not many normal people stick to the end

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,400
Do you think it’s normal if you don’t eat one meal a month?

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,900
Personal physique, some people resist hunger, some people don’t resist hunger

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,100
I believe most people are the latter

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,800
Of course, anti-hunger requires training. The human stomach is flexible, but it can be large or small.

16
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,900
The stomach of people who resist hunger must be a big deal

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,300
You said that some big stomach kings don’t seem to be fat

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,900
That’s because he vomited in the toilet after eating, and didn’t let you see it.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,500
So I want to say that if you want to lose weight, you have to shrink your stomach, and you will be full after eating a little.

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,500
Don’t forget that the ultimate goal of weight loss is to develop a lean body

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,100
Don’t gain weight by eating anything, eat what you like, don’t restrain yourself

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,700
Of course, to lose weight, you must go on diet or fasting training to ensure your health.

23
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,900
This is scientific

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,300
If it’s just to be thinner and thinner, compare with thinner

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,200
That will only hurt your body, not worth imitating

26
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,000
The ideal weight of a person is after calculating BMI

27
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,800
Determined according to the average level of your country

28
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,900
Setting goals blindly is unscientific, unhealthy, and unrealistic

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,900
Next I will talk about the pros and cons of dieting or fasting to lose weight

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,900
Before that, let me add a digression, no matter what way to lose weight

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,800
It’s liposuction, carnitine, exercise

32
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,700
More purpose is to look better

33
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,700
For men to show off their abdominal muscles, and for women to show off their long legs, they are more for others to see

34
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,400
What is healthy or unhealthy, not many people care about it before

35
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,700
Now more and more people care about this

36
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,400
Not only to be thin, but to be healthy and happy

37
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,400
If the process of losing weight is painful, it will be difficult to stick to it

38
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,700
Even if you persist, you will eventually become sickly thin

39
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,100
What's more, the ultimate goal of weight loss is not just to lose weight

40
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,800
Do you think about why you lose weight? Is it for the weight to stop rebounding?

41
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,900
Eat whatever you want

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,100
If you keep on dieting for a period of time, your weight will indeed drop

43
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,100
The process is also very painful

44
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,500
If one day you really can't control yourself

45
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,100
It’s easy to overeating, because I’ve been holding back for so long

46
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,800
At this time, the rebound speed will be very fast, and the weight loss will be lost.

47
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,200
So I just rely on will to lose weight

48
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,700
No sustainable development. Because people’s desire is greater than their will, they have to go with the flow.

49
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,100
You are not a monk, and you are not a ninja, so there is no need for such painful restraint of desire

50
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,000
Intermittent fasting + moderate exercise is currently one of the mainstream scientific ways to lose weight

51
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,300
To put it bluntly, it means to shut your mouth and open your legs

52
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,700
But it’s relatively harder to stick to it, because it may take several days without eating

53
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,400
For people who are accustomed to three meals a day, they are hungry without eating, let alone for several days

54
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,900
So it’s a scientific, effective and easy way to lose weight, I personally think it’s one meal a day

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,700
In fact, many people have mentioned this way in the video

56
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,300
It’s just that I have some opinions of my own, which are different from them

57
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,000
One meal a day not only satisfies the appetite, but also achieves the goal of dieting and weight loss, while saving a lot of time

58
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,400
If you want to stick to one meal a day, you still need a gradual process

59
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,800
I have a plan here that can adapt to one meal a day for people who have three meals a day

60
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,500
Start with two meals a day, and eat every meal.

61
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,200
Actually it’s like most people don’t eat breakfast, it’s not difficult

62
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,700
After getting used to it, reduce food intake and eat seventy percent full for every meal

63
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,700
At this time, I feel a little hunger every day

64
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,600
When you are hungry, you can reduce hunger by distracting

65
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,800
The easiest is to play with the phone, the whole day passed

66
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,700
When you are really hungry, drink a sugar-free drink or skim milk

67
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,500
It’s not difficult to hold your stomach, when your body adapts

68
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,400
Continue to reduce food intake. Or two meals a day

69
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,200
This process will be a little bit painful, but not particularly difficult

70
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,300
Soon your body will adapt, when your body adapts

71
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,600
Your stomach shrinks a bit, and you’re full after eating a little

72
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,400
Don’t worry about malnutrition

73
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,700
The nutrients stored in your body are enough for you to use for a month or two

74
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,600
Unless you are already malnourished, I believe there are not many people who are malnourished who need to lose weight.

75
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,800
Malnutrition and losing weight is death

76
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,300
Of course the situation I’m talking about here excludes some puffy people

77
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,900
The main reason they are fat is that they eat too much junk food

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,800
Even if you are fat, you may be malnourished

79
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,100
Can you eat junk food instead of regular meals during the diet?

80
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,200
It’s okay, it’s just unhealthy, no one stops you if you have to eat

81
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,800
Anyway, as long as you eat less, you can lose weight. When your appetite decreases

82
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,300
One meal a day seems very relaxing, but don’t be too happy

83
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,100
There is still some way to lose weight

84
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,000
Because the state at this time is unstable, you may resume three meals a day at any time

85
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,900
It has even become more edible than before, after all, I have been holding back for so long. So the solution is

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,900
Raise the goal a bit higher, one meal every two days

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,900
This meal must be fully eaten, otherwise it will be difficult to persist

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,300
And the nutrition should be comprehensive, snacks are not good

89
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,100
In order to prevent malnutrition, it is best to eat some vitamins, such as a good pill after a meal

90
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,900
Why do you have to eat once every two days? This is to make you more resistant to hunger and last longer

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,800
When you think it’s not difficult to have one meal in two days, resume one meal a day plan

92
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,800
At this time you will feel that one meal a day is no different from three meals

93
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,800
It’s normal, without any psychological pressure, it’s natural

94
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,300
As the saying goes

95
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,400
If your goal from start to finish is one meal a day

96
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,300
It will be more difficult for you to persist because your body’s adaptability has not yet reached this level

97
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,000
It’s like having someone who never exercises do push-ups

98
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,900
He couldn't do one at first, but after training, he can finally do one

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,900
But after a period of time, let him do it again, it will be very difficult for him, and he can’t even do one.

100
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,400
If this person’s initial goal is to do ten, then his training difficulty and intensity will be higher

101
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,200
After a long time, let him do one more, he will feel very relaxed

102
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,100
So, the one meal plan is not as simple as you think

103
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,100
The most important thing is long-term persistence, which does not count as one or two days.

104
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,800
Compared with a thorough fasting to lose weight, the effect of losing weight with one meal a day will be slower

105
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,300
The degree of pain is much smaller, there is almost no pain after adapting

106
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,600
Fasting to lose weight is different. You can’t eat for two or three days, you can only drink a little water

107
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,700
Not much harm to the body in a short time, and no malnutrition

108
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,300
But after a long time, it will definitely hurt, at least it will have low blood sugar.

109
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,200
Like those who are still energetic without eating for days, most of them are fitness coaches.

110
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,800
At the same time, they are a bit fat, they are very resistant to hunger, and their metabolism is much faster than ordinary people.

111
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,700
Fat consumption rate is also higher, scientific fasting time is 72 hours

112
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,500
Exceeding this time may cause organ failure

113
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,800
Of course it’s not so absolute, this is an average

114
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,700
Some people just resist hunger. The process is painful during fasting or dieting

115
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,100
Remember not to watch food shows, this will make you hungry more and more, and you can’t even control yourself

116
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:52,000
You can lose weight without eating, does that mean you can lose weight without eating?

117
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,400
Is it possible to fast for a while and refresh for a while?

118
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,300
This is the theory, but the reality is the opposite

119
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,100
This may starve to death, but before starving to death, most people choose to eat

120
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,700
Because this is the instinct of carbon-based organisms

121
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,700
The order in which the human body consumes energy is sugar, fat, and protein

122
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,700
But never consume protein after the fat is 100% exhausted

123
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,800
This is why people who starve to death also have a lot of fat

124
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:23,900
Because consuming fat also needs fat, he doesn’t even have fat to consume fat

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,800
Then it can only consume muscle. And consuming muscles also requires a lot of energy

126
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,600
He doesn’t even have the most basic energy to sustain life, so he can only starve to death

127
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,400
This is equivalent to the phone is dead and automatically shut down

128
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,700
At the same time, I also answered the sentence: How can I lose weight without eating?

129
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,300
Share my experience of intermittent fasting

130
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,200
The first time I fasted, I lost 8 catties of meat in 4 days

131
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,100
Drink only one box of yogurt every day, do fat burning exercises, and measure your weight on a scale every day

132
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,800
On average, I can lose about 1 kilogram a day, very effective

133
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:57,200
In the end, the reason why I couldn’t keep going was because there were snacks around, I couldn’t help it.

134
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,800
After eating snacks, I never want to endure this kind of suffering and pain anymore

135
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,800
Return to normal diet. You will ask, are you hungry?

136
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,700
I’m hungry, but I’m not very hungry. I can bear it. This is unexpected.

137
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,600
Not hungry enough to growl. May be the reason for drinking yogurt

138
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,500
The pain I am talking about is not physical pain, everything is normal in the body

139
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:20,000
What I’m talking about is that you have to control yourself not to eat if you have food around you. This psychological torture is painful

140
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,800
I lost 16 pounds of meat in 10 days on the second fast

141
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,800
I originally planned to lose 40 pounds of meat a month, and then my future life depends on

142
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,400
One meal a day, one high-quality meal a day, to maintain your weight

143
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,900
The result was defeated by reality. In the early morning of the 11th day, I was hungry and woke up, not a nightmare. Was awakened from starvation alive

144
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,500
Because I felt very hungry before I went to bed on the 10th night

145
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
But I told myself that if I persisted for a few more days

146
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,000
I woke up after only two hours of sleep

147
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,000
After waking up, my heart beats faster and I feel like I'm going to die

148
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,400
It’s like Ultraman’s red light, can’t hold on anymore

149
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,200
I hurriedly frozen the rice that I cooked half a month ago in the refrigerator and took out all of it and put it in the microwave

150
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,000
I made another meal by the way, which is equivalent to eating three meals in one meal

151
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,300
But I'm full before I finish eating because my stomach shrinks

152
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,100
Although I did not stick to the end and did not lose weight successfully, it was effective anyway

153
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,300
My appetite has decreased a lot, and I can be full with just a little bit

154
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:14,100
For these 10 days, I rely on drinking fruit juice, yogurt, sugar-free beverages, without a little fat intake

155
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,000
There is a small amount of sugar, sugar will quickly turn into fat

156
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,900
In order to reduce the fat conversion rate, do a little fat burning exercise every day

157
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,200
Do very little, worry about running out of strength today, and unable to recover tomorrow

158
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,300
I feel a little more dizzy compared to eating

159
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,600
Because of short-term hypoglycemia, my body has not adapted to it

160
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,000
But my strength is not weakened, the same as those who exercised during fasting said

161
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:40,000
I believe that when your hunger reaches a certain level, you must go back and take the initiative to eat

162
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,700
Desire will defeat your will

163
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,200
This is not the age of famine, this is the age of over-nutrition, so I have to lose weight

164
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,400
Are those who do fasting challenges really not hungry? the answer is negative

165
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,700
They must be hungry, so why do some people say that they don’t feel hungry at all without eating for a week?

166
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,200
He was hungry and numb. For example, surgery, anesthetics

167
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,400
It was very painful at first, but after taking the anesthetic, you don’t feel very painful anymore

168
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,100
At this time, you say that cutting meat doesn't hurt at all. Do you think it's appropriate?

169
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,900
He said there is no hunger, it means that you can distract

170
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,600
To forget about hunger, it’s not a real sense of hunger

171
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,500
Humans are made of meat, not machines, just charge it up

172
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,100
But it’s not as hungry as imagined. The human body is adaptive.

173
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,600
Originally, you are not hungry. After a period of time, your body adapts

174
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,600
That little bit of hunger is trivial

175
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,700
At this time he can say: I am not hungry at all

176
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,500
Pain will make you stronger. Of course everything has to be scaled

177
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,000
Fasting training for a long time is harmful to the body

178
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,200
May be malnourished, so vitamins and trace elements should be added in time

179
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,000
In the absence of food intake, the food in the body is exhausted

180
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,800
The body produces an autophagy effect. In addition to fat, it will consume

181
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:51,900
Skipping meals will speed up the metabolism and make people more energetic in a short time, but eating will make you sleepier

182
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,200
Why do people have fat and grow small belly

183
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,700
Because primitive people eat irregularly, the last meal may not be the next

184
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,900
So every meal has to eat as much as possible, excess energy, no place to store

185
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,700
So fats that can store energy for longer have evolved

186
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,200
It’s more exciting the next time you hunt

187
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,700
The rate of fat consumption is relatively slow, and it is not enough to lose weight by skipping meals

188
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,200
Also do delayed fat burning exercise, delayed fat burning exercise is not like aerobic exercise

189
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,600
It takes 30 minutes to consume fat. Of course, this is just a reference number, and I can’t believe it all.

190
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,500
Delay fat burning, only need to do about five or six minutes of training, you can burn fat

191
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,700
Even if you stop exercising and start to rest, you will continue to burn fat

192
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:40,200
Until the body cools down and stops sweating. Like poppy jumping, pull-ups, variable speed running, boxing, etc.

193
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:45,100
For girls, you can choose a relatively relaxed aerobic exercise

194
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,000
Like jumping and jogging

195
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,100
If you exercise regularly and these are not difficult for you, then you can choose higher intensity training

196
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,600
Delaying fat burning exercise is equivalent to simmering in flames, and you can’t enjoy the joy of exercise

197
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,400
Only endless pain can be used to vent emotions, the advantage is obvious: save time

198
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,300
Aerobic exercise is like simmering in a small fire, slow work and careful work, you can enjoy the happiness brought by exercise

199
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,400
The disadvantage is obvious: it is time-consuming. Choose according to personal preference

200
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,000
After talking about one meal a day, let’s talk about three meals a day. Its historical origin

201
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,600
In ancient times, people had two meals a day, one meal when they went out to work in the morning, and another one when they returned home from work in the afternoon.

202
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,400
No food at night, no electricity, no entertainment, only lying down and sleeping

203
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,400
Sometimes there is a curfew at night, no door is given

204
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,500
I can only hear the eunuch shouting outside: The sky is dry and everything is dry, watch out for the fire

205
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,800
During the Song Dynasty, the night market was opened, so you can go out at night and go shopping and shopping.

206
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,400
The people of the Song Dynasty were prosperous, and two meals were too small

207
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,300
I have nothing to do at night, so I might as well cook something, so three meals a day became popular

208
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:44,200
If the civilian life of the Song Dynasty is really as luxurious as the legend, eating, drinking, having fun, and ordering takeaway

209
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,900
Finally, I will mention the dieting technique, which is to reduce appetite. When do you not want to eat?

210
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,400
Eat something bad, but some bad things are nutritious

211
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,600
To reduce my appetite in the past, I accidentally found that protein powder was really awful

212
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,500
But it’s very nutritious. After a drink, I don’t want to eat all day. It’s really effective.

213
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,500
But it was so uncomfortable, I finally had to give up

214
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,900
Let’s say so much today, I wish you all weight loss success
