00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:03,100
Hey, What's Up! My TM is Xiao Cai, who is your TM?

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,000
You are welcome to tmd to tmd my tmd channel, Yeah!

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,200
The thing called money is omnipotent, and there is nothing that cannot be bought

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,000
Only things that cannot be afforded, so-called unavailable, are purely sour

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,500
Or chicken soup to comfort the loser

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,700
You will definitely refute in your heart that money cannot bring people back to life

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,000
This sentence is right on the surface, but in fact it is only half right

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,500
If it is a physical resurrection

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,700
Judging from the current technology, it is still in the experimental stage, and it is difficult to truly realize

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,500
But if you have money, you can continue to throw money to scientists to study this technology

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,000
And scientific research originally required the country to spend a lot of money on experiments

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,600
The purpose is to make more money in the market after the experiment is successful

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,500
If it is a spiritual resurrection, this can be done

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,200
Because the so-called death is forgotten

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,600
Then just let people remember someone

16
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,800
He will live in our hearts forever

17
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,700
This is easy to handle. More money is thrown to expose the media to this person’s life story.

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,600
Find some senior editors to beautify this person

19
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,000
As long as there is enough money and headlines every day, I don’t believe you will forget this person

20
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,800
You may also argue that money can’t make people who don’t love you fall in love with you

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:22,000
Then I want to ask you, where does the person who loves you love?

22
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,400
Is it purely attracted by your personal charm?

23
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,700
The assumption is, what is your personal charm?

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Is it your talent? Still rely on the money you have earned?

25
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:37,100
Obviously it’s the money you earn from falling in love with your talents.

26
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,300
You would say that girls look for boys, not just money

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,800
Also depends on appearance, height, way of speaking, temper

28
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,900
Waiting for harsh conditions is actually secondary

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,500
As long as money is in place, everything is in place

30
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,000
Ugly looks, go for a facelift, the height is bruised

31
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,300
If it is outstanding in other aspects, it can be made up

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,500
It’s hard to speak, it doesn’t matter

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,300
The main thing is to take her out to eat, go shopping, watch movies,

34
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,800
If you drive a sports car to the door

35
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,800
Say: Hi, take you out to play? What is there to say?

36
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,700
What do you say if you have a weird temper and a discordant personality?

37
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,600
Look at the men on the rich list, which is not a neuropathy

38
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,600
Which is not divorced several times?

39
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,400
But does anyone say they are neurotic? No

40
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,300
People will only say: hello has connotation, you are so detached!

41
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,100
Those who have no money will only be scolded and sick, this is the reality

42
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,900
So you have to make more money, just have money, everything else is secondary

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,300
What else do you think money can't buy?

44
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,300
For example, buy the earth?

45
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,800
There is nothing wrong with this, the present owner of the earth is now human

46
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,100
You have to dominate the planet and be the boss now

47
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,600
There must be a war, whether it can be won, 99% depends on the weapon

48
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,600
Weapons are bought with money. Obviously, the more expensive the weapon, the more advanced

49
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,000
Then you can buy all the most advanced weapons of humanity

50
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,900
Isn't this where nobody can beat you? Isn't it?

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,900
You might also say that money can't buy time.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,600
This sentence looks fine on the surface, but it is out of place in reality

53
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,400
I just want to ask you, did you make a lot of time for the money you made at work?

54
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:18,400
And the salary the company pays you is equivalent to buying your time with money

55
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,500
You are selling your life, life is time

56
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,400
Then you pay for food, drink and fun, did you buy someone else's time?

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,200
Others are selling his time, you are enjoying the time in exchange for money

58
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,200
You said that I am clearly enjoying the material life?

59
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,800
But the essence of matter is time, your movement in space

60
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,700
Is the trace left by time

61
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,300
If you can’t understand it, just let it go, anyway, the material and time in my eyes are the same thing

62
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,500
Money is more than the numbers in your mobile wallet

63
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,900
It is essentially a symbol of value, so it is called a general equivalent

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,700
I’m not teaching you here, I’m just mentioning common sense.

65
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,200
How to make money? Let's not mention making big money, are you worthy?

66
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,600
Let's start with making small money, such as street food:

67
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,800
Brother, I would like the hot duck duck intestine

68
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,100
He spent two minutes to do it for you, you gave him a dozen dollars

69
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,000
Why can he make money? Because it's delicious! It's that simple

70
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,100
Solve the needs of a class of people

71
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,800
Why did he make small money?

72
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,100
So many people like to eat teppanyaki duck intestines.

73
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,300
Because of the fierce competition, it’s not just his family that sells

74
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,600
Yishan is higher than Yishan, who makes delicious food, who makes money

75
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,300
Of course, those geographical locations and other natural reasons are not my concern

76
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,600
This is a good decision they have considered before doing business

77
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,000
On the other hand, if you don’t make it, you won’t make money.

78
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,700
Or you can't make ends meet, any industry has enough to eat and support

79
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,600
I can’t eat enough and starve to death, so I’m doing the same thing. I’m eliminated without core competitiveness.

80
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:55,200
Let's talk about making big money, or just the example just now, what kind of thinking is the person making small money?

81
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,500
I want to make my own food the best

82
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,900
I want to let more people know that my food is the best

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,700
What is the idea of ​​the big money maker? I want to open more branches

84
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,300
I want more people to join our store, I want to build my own brand

85
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,200
I want to monopolize this market, I want to let my peers have no food to eat, and finally I am annexed

86
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,000
This is the essential difference, a gap on the ideological level

87
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,900
Of course, just thinking without action is empty talk

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,700
The reality is still cruel, not so easy to succeed

89
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,600
You can think of ways to make money

90
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:31,600
What to do, I had to have some personal characteristics while imitating others

91
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,400
Besides, the iron duck intestines just now, so many people are selling

92
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,000
I have to be different from others, so I have to develop some exclusive formulas

93
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,300
Others can't imitate it, and then experiment

94
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,500
Take a look at the most popular formula. After the experiment is successful, keep making it.

95
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,600
At the same time, optimize the service to give customers a better experience

96
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,500
Why don’t those who work hard make money because those who make money don’t need to

97
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,500
Why am I saying so vaguely, I won't tell you

98
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,300
This is an industry secret, but I can also reveal a secret word to you:

99
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:08,300
Look at the leeks, cut a stubble, grow a stubble, grow fast! Hey!

100
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,700
In addition to the evil money, is there anything pure in the world?

101
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,200
I don’t want to be so profitable, I don’t want to be so material

102
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,400
I just want to be simple

103
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,900
Sorry, really not

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,400
Only evil money, so give me all evil money

105
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,600

Brany-money minimum Mini-mini-mini-mini minimum

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,700
When it comes to pure things, I think of the most pretentious words

109
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,400
The line in "Mermaid": If there is not even a drop of clean water in this world

110
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,000
No matter how much money you make, it's a dead end!

111
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,300
I just want to say: if there is no money, even the water plant can go bankrupt

112
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,800
Do you still drink clean water?

113
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:06,200
The rich are worthy of drinking clean water, and the poor are only worthy of drinking dirty water. This is the reality!

114
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,900
Not to mention the environmental protection industry

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,100
It doesn't need money any more. Without money, even a volunteer cannot recruit!

116
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,200
This line is not genuine in nature

117
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,100
Just to move the audience and earn more movie tickets

118
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,700
If you sincerely call on others to be environmentally friendly

119
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,400
So why are so many advertisements still being planted in the movie, isn't it for the purpose of making money?

120
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,700
Of course there is nothing wrong with it, I just used it as an example

121
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,600
