00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,000
Hey guys! What's Up!

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,000
This is Xiao Cai. Welcome to Xiao Cai Talk Show.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,900
This is my first video, I do nâ€™t know what to talk about,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,300
Starting with the simplest, today we will talk about the mantra.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,300
Think carefully, you often hear some mantras,

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,200
I have summarized something that I can often hear.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:26,200
For example:"OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, whatever"

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,400
Like these perfunctory but not excessive rhetoric,

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,200
Almost everyone will say that both acquaintances and strangers will use it.

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,500
Just like:"â€˜ Is my food delicious? Okay. â€™

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,400
â€˜Do you like spicy food? still alright'

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,700
"How about this movie?" Very good, okay '. "

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,500
Although not everyone answered this, it is certain that this is the answer of the vast majority of people,

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,100
A conclusion is drawn from this-

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,400
Anyone who puts words like "OK" on their lips

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,500
Must be an ordinary person.

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,500
You will definitely refute, what else can I say without saying "OK"?

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,900
You just talk about specific subjective feelings in a little more detail

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,200
Or objective evaluation is a hundred times stronger than saying "OK", ordinary people!

20
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,100
In fact, in previous street interviews,

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,500
Many passersby answered some ambiguous neutral words,

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,600
One mouth is â€˜okayâ€™ now gone, because

23
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,500
The people who cut the film also know that it is boring, so they cut it off.

24
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,800
Why do Chinese people like to say these euphemistic neutral words?

25
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:44,700
This is not only indescribable but also low-key.

26
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,400
I personally think,

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,300
It is because China has been under too much feudal rule since ancient times,

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,500
If you say something wrong, you will be killed.

29
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,400
Cause people's minds to be confined and dare not tell the truth

30
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,400
Anyway, obedient people live longer, and disobedient people die early. Every day kills chickens and monkeys,

31
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Who dares to tell the truth?

32
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,400
So, all we can say is these ambiguous neutral words.

33
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,400
So it spread.

34
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,900
It can be accepted by most people, and it can only be unspeakable.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,300
For example, the same word:"OK", the tone is different, the face is different,

36
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,100
The meaning of the expression will be exactly the opposite.

37
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,400
For example, I asked you, "Who do you think is beautiful?"

38
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,300
"You smile half blush and say:" OK "

39
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,500
That's what it means.

40
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,800
If I ask you, "Who do you think is ugly?",

41
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,700
You hummed and said, "OK",

42
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,900
That is what ugly means.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,800
Why not say it directly, you have to guess.

44
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,800
I summed up the following reasons.

45
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,400
First of all, it may be that you have not thought about it or are embarrassed.

46
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,400
The second is to worry about leaks and gossip behind others.

47
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,800
The main thing I think is

48
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,200
Herd psychology that follows the mainstream and is assimilated.

49
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,300
People are like clouds, without learning.

50
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,900
Everyone says "okay", what you say is different from others,

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,400
Then we will reject you, who will tell you the truth. what?

52
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:20,400
Then, in order to cater to everyone, there will be someone who will become a raccoon dog and a crowd.

53
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,700
Realistic helplessness, sometimes have no choice.

54
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,500
But sometimes personality is also very important, such as invention,

55
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,200
If someone else has made something for a long time, you still imitate it, then you will always be a cottage.

56
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,100
As another example, when answering questions in class, others' answers are the same.

57
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,000
What you think is different from others, but you are afraid to say wrong,

58
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,900
You hesitated for a while, and finally answered the same views as others,

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This loses personality.

60
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,600
Of course I say this, you may not feel the use of personality.

61
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,400
Let me give another extreme example,

62
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,300
For example, in the historical Nanjing Massacre, three devils watched a group of people,

63
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,800
No one dares to resist.

64
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,200
Of course, if I pointed a gun at my head, I might not dare to resist,

65
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,600
I can scare urine.

66
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:16,200
But I was all about to die. It was a knife horizontally and a knife vertically.

67
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,500
Why don't you go all out?

68
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,000
But no one resists, why should I resist?

69
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,900
Why should I be a dead ghost? Die together!

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,100
At this time, if more personalized people can go out shopping,

71
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,000
Maybe this group of people could be saved.

72
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,700
But no one would do this,

73
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,000
I think it's okay.

74
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,900
Okay, we will talk here today. See you next time. Bye ðŸ‘‹

Come take a look at our team,

77
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,900
This is light, this is photography,

78
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,500
This is the director, this is the actor,

79
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,200
this is

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,300
Background

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,500
This is the late stage, this is the special effect

82
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,500
This is a screenwriter

83
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,300
He is still one

84
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,700
Honest honest man
