00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:04,500
Hey, What's Up! This is Xiao Cai. Welcome to my channel!

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,700
Congratulations, you have been tricked in

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,000
I didn’t teach you to surf the net

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,900
You see the title, you know, this is a debate, I’m doing a speech

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,800
To be honest, it’s kind of sad to overturn the wall

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,700
Because the Internet that should have been freely accessed in mainland China

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,800
Being constantly blocked, only the internal network is allowed inside the wall.

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,000
Many people don’t even notice the existence of the wall

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,900
So why do we come over the wall and go online scientifically, are we free?

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,300
If you want to go to the extranet and go abroad, you can’t do it. It’s the same for Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,200
But there is no money. In addition to the difficulty of accessing the Internet in China, other things are very convenient.

12
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,100
Can you use the intranet without going to the extranet?

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,800
No, if the intranet is easy to use, who would struggle to access the extranet?

14
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,700
That Baidu is really a copycat.

15
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,300
Soulai search is all water stickers, no matter how advanced search

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,800
Filtering search is still a water sticker, or it’s a lie

17
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,500
Google is the same sometimes, but there are not so many restrictions

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,600
Higher accuracy, you can also watch small yellow films

19
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,500
So this is very sad, one of the most distant distances in the world is the disconnection

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,800
Why do you want to block the network? Take the old road of clearing the government's closed door?

21
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,900
This involves a lot of sensitive topics. We are physically inside the wall and we can’t tell the truth.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,600
On the mainland, we are not qualified to talk about politics

23
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,000
Otherwise, it’s easy to get caught

24
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,900
That's the legendary drink tea, check the water meter and the like

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,200
Even threatens family members, so these sensitive issues

26
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,000
Just have a heart in your heart and live your little life

27
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,000
And most of those who dare to tell the truth are over the wall physically

28
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,300
That is to emigrate overseas

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,200
Those who didn’t physically turn over the wall, were caught as soon as they told the truth, and even broke their families

30
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:02,200
So I dare not say it, dare to speak without anger, admit to counseling, hold it down if you are not convinced, and try to lie down with your salary.

31
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,400
Over the wall, there are two main categories

32
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,600
One is over the wall, the other is over the wall.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,200
Spiritually turning the wall is at the technical level, breaking through the network blockade and cyber attacks

34
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,700
Of course, this is a protracted battle, not to say that it is once and for all

35
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,400
All those titles that say permanently over the wall are all deceiving CTR

36
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,000
The spirit relies on technology, of course, the technology is not enough, the money comes together

37
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:29,000
Nodes built by yourself will often be blocked soon, and it works in the first two years

38
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,500
Now it is blocked as soon as it is built, and it cannot withstand firewall attacks at all

39
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,500
It takes a lot of time and energy to resurrect

40
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,400
Continuous self-maintenance, can't afford to play, but also very tired

41
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,500
You can only buy someone else's airport

42
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,000
Of course it’s not that someone’s airport will not be blocked

43
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,900
Someone in the background is maintaining, and if they are blocked, they will be unblocked.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,300
Seal one solution, one solution one, one solution one.

45
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,100
We haven't done backstage yet

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,200
What is the equivalent of building a node and maintaining a node?

47
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,800
Driving and repairing the car, I'm willing to drive the car, I don't want to repair it if it's broken

48
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:11,900
I have to find someone else to do it, and I am not incapable of doing it, but it is time-consuming and exhausting.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,700
Not necessarily good repairs, or even bad repairs.

50
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,600
Those people who are unwilling to do their jobs will spawn a type of work, that is, those who sell airports

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,400
I’ll just spend some money and save some time, otherwise I will spend all day on repairing the car

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,400
How tired I can't do anything

53
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:33,000
How to update the method of turning over the wall, nothing more than two agreements, one is SOCKS, the other is VMess

54
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,500
The SSR you use is a batch of SOCKS5 nodes, which is the airport.

55
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,100
The V2ray and Trojan you use are all VMess plus some DIY encryption modes

56
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,600
Everyone knows the mainstream way, but it’s not as powerful as the legend

57
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:52,100
Like what ws+tls+web, https traffic disguised as mainland, looks seamless

58
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:59,200
But in the end, it will still be seen through the wall and then blocked, but it is relatively longer and the cost of resurrection is lower.

59
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,700
But the technical cost is high, the operating cost is high

60
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,400
Are you willing to drive, and are you willing to repair the car?

61
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,300
What's more, it can sometimes be as complicated as building a car! Why bother?

62
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,200
If you have enough time, just toss yourself. Anyway, I was completely exhausted.

63
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:21,200
Anyway, the wall will not be demolished in the first half, so I can only seek the redemption of Xiao Shenke in this network prison.

64
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,000
Of course, spiritual overturning does not mean spiritual freedom

65
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,400
I’m talking about those who are patriotic over the wall

66
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,700
He thinks it's right to block the network, he will not blame those who make firewalls

67
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,900
He feels well controlled, at least invisible

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
He feels that most of the world outside the wall is reactionary, and there are many traitors

69
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,400
With the wall, you can shield out the dirty things he doesn’t want to see, at least not seeing is clean

70
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:50,400
Even if there is blood flowing outside and corpses are raging across the field, it's a matter of my care. Am I in charge?

71
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,300
Most people think this way, for people like us who look angry

72
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,200
They are not saved, in turn, for them, we are abandon

73
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,000
We are not saved

74
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,500
We will only be treated as brainwashed by reactionary remarks

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,700
What should I do? Don’t talk about politics, you should eat, drink, drink

76
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,500
Pretend to be deaf and dumb

77
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,400
Anyway, some big truths can only be suffocated, and rotten in my heart

78
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,800
Anyway, it's useless to say it, only to be regarded as a lunatic

79
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,800
After talking about the mental over the wall, let's talk about the physical over the wall

80
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,600
I’m an immigrant if I’m physically over the wall.

81
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,300
It stands to reason that after going abroad, you can accept some free and open new ideas

82
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,700
But the reality is often the opposite, overseas pinks are also everywhere

83
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,300
I remember an overseas student who said he wanted to oppose freedom of speech and was scolded by a group of people

84
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:45,000
How do you deal with this little overseas pink? I just want to shoot him, forgive him for being a god

85
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,400
We are only responsible for sending him to God

86
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,600
You must be thinking in your heart, the United States is so chaotic, why should I go abroad?

87
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,400
Free, Americans live like the end of the world

88
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,300
Have you ever considered why you can only see the negative news of the United States in China

89
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,800
There is not a little positive news

90
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:06,300
You don’t even see people sponsoring poor people in the country and doing charity

91
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,200
In China, I can only see what the ban is on the evaluation of the African currency, and follow him to fight together

92
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,300
Xi Jinping's name is right, no comments are allowed

93
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,200
It’s the same in the United States, where you can’t see positive news about China and prohibit China’s rise.

94
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,700
Pressed Huawei hard and let him get out

95
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,000
Why should there be malicious competition, what is the picture?

96
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,400
I don’t tell you, you know, when the world’s boss chants

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
For example, the gang boss has a second-in-command who wants to usurp

98
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,300
Once found, he will be killed sooner or later

99
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,200
But these leaders are not vegetarian, he also has countermeasures

100
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,400
Let others catch the handle

101
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,100
Isn't that the competition of big powers?

102
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,000
To brainwash the people of their own country, only praise and no criticism

103
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,100
It’s like a domestic social software, only like, no step

104
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,300
You don’t want to suffocate, or get out

105
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,600
This kind of big power competition is all about scams, you die

106
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,500
I am dead, you are happy, you are dead, I am happy, I want to set off fireworks

107
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,400
In a word, sooner or later, the other party will be killed, but this is a long process

108
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,600
There will always be some ambiguous interest exchanges in the middle, that is, dirty transactions

109
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,200
To make an analogy, I originally grabbed you

110
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,800
To whip you with a whip, fan you with ear scrapers, but you have money

111
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,500
Gave me a million and wanted me to let you go

112
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,300
I'm not stupid, let you go, don't you find someone to get revenge?

113
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,300
But I'm greedy for money, and I'll collect it when I give it, so I won't worry about the debt

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,100
You have given money, then I won’t beat you, but I can’t help but let you go

115
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,200
Isn't it important that the interests of major powers are exchanged?

116
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,200
Go back and talk about the principle of overturning the wall

117
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,600
No matter how advanced the technology of turning over the wall is

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,100
Don’t you just change IP? You seal one and I change one

119
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,700
You might say that some over-the-wall technology can ignore the firewall, so that the firewall cannot detect abnormal traffic

120
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,600
You think about it carefully

121
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:58,500
Overturning the wall permanently, ignoring the firewall, but after a while, he began to hit his face

122
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,400
Did you start a tutorial on permanently turning over the wall again?

123
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,200
If it is permanent, is it not enough for you to post a video? right?

124
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,800
Besides the firewall, no matter how updated its technology is, how to strengthen the attack

125
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,700
Isn’t it all the same? Seal IP, you change one, I seal one

126
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:20,200
People over the wall are not vegetarian. You can block my IP and I will be able to revive the IP. Who is afraid of who!

127
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,300
I feel uncomfortable without crossing the wall

128
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,800
When will this endless war, which is one foot tall and one demon tall, be over?

129
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,500
Probably in October this year, it is said that the United States is spending huge sums of money to demolish the wall!

130
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,400
I didn't want to believe this kind of thing at first, why wouldn't I do it earlier if I could demolish the wall?

131
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,800
The ghost knows what's going on?

132
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:43,100
But now I don’t want to believe it, I have to give myself a hint of hope and comfort myself with chicken broth

133
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,000
There is also Musk, not Marx, of course it is similar

134
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,900
Musk, his small company, puts satellites to play every day, and dozens of small satellites go up,

135
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,800
Just make the space around the earth the same as the dump, the artificial satellite has a very short life span

136
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:02,100
Less than two or three years, more than ten years, to put it plainly, it is all garbage

137
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,400
Everyone sitting here is trash

138
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,300
What can these satellites do? Engage in the star chain project, put the earth in a fishing net

139
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,200
This is not a new concept. Organizations that can launch satellites are thinking about how to trap the earth.

140
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,700
It’s just a matter of money. If you send one, anyone can send it, and I can send it.

141
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,500
Thousands of satellites are distributed, there are not so rich organizations

142
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,700
Including Musk’s company, not so much money

143
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,100
However, if there is no money, there is a cheaper way

144
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,000
Basically, 400 to 600 satellites can barely operate a star chain project

145
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,800
Once it works, the firewall can't stop it

146
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:37,100
Because you can connect to WiFi without the operator's signal tower, but you need a receiving base station

147
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,100
It's similar to watching satellite TV in the past

148
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,300
It will definitely be regulated at that time, prohibiting the connection of Musk’s WiFi

149
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,300
And Musk in order to allow the mainland to connect to WiFi

150
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,300
It may be bought by the government, which means that the external network you connect to is a filtered external network

151
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,900
Generally speaking, it is much better than before, at least no wall-over tool

152
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Remember the WiFi balloon project developed by Google in previous years?

153
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,100
It is still in full swing!

154
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,700
The WiFi balloon developed by Google aims to connect remote areas to the Internet

155
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,500
At present, Sri Lanka has fully covered WiFi balloons

156
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,500
Compared with laying a lot of optical fiber, it is indeed a lot more money saving

157
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,600
However, they can’t enter China, they are under government control, and don’t put WiFi balloons.

158
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,000
If the government agrees, the area of ​​WiFi covered by a balloon is about 40 square kilometers

159
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,500
To cover the entire continent, many balloons are needed

160
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,000
The life span of this kind of balloon is not long, that is more than three months

161
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,000
Remove the old one and replace it with a new one

162
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,400
This kind of balloon is a helium balloon, not a hot air balloon

163
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,700
An antenna is also needed to connect to WiFi, which looks like a lollipop

164
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,400
It really doesn't work in China

165
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
However, with Google's exclusion from China, the project is progressing smoothly

166
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,600
Currently island countries like New Zealand and Australia

167
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,500
Some of the remote areas above have basically covered almost

168
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
In fact, this kind of balloon is suitable for connecting to the island

169
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,000
If I bought a small island and didn’t have a network, to connect to the Internet, I had to connect with a submarine cable

170
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,200
If my island is a very remote island in the Pacific Ocean

171
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,500
It’s not realistic, let Google put a balloon

172
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,000
Crossing the wall is a kind of sorrow, it is a national shame

173
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,200
It imprisons more than one billion Chinese people in invisible prisons

174
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,700
It imprisoned not criminals, but countless free souls

175
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,300
If you have a prison, you want to escape from prison.

176
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,800
Quite tragic, but the reality is often the opposite

177
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:23,400
I feel that most people don’t care if they are imprisoned in an invisible prison

178
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,000
They think they are alive and well, they just have enough to eat, not so much thought

179
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,900
So, it’s all deserved to be blunt, even when leeks deserve to be harvested

180
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,800
You might say that it is because of the firewall that China can become a world power

181
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:43,000
That's right, the wall at the head. This strength is based on the fool and the weak

182
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,000
Am i right

183
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:50,100
If you like my video, please remember to share it and turn on the small bell!

184
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,000
See you next time, bye!
