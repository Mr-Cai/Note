00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:03,200
Hey, What's Up! This is Xiao Cai, welcome to my channel!

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,900
Is this greeting okay?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Compared with Hello everyone, Iâ€™m Lao Gao

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,200
Which one is more earthy? Obviously still my soil

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:22,400
Everyone is welcome to watch Xiao Cai's talk show with earthy ground, cough cough cough!

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,700
Talk show!

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,600
[Beatbox]

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,000


9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,600
What are you doing? Where else can I go!

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,700
What if I add a transition sound effect? Not fragrant?

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,900
If you are interested in Tucao and talk show, please subscribe to my channel

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,800
In order not to miss the wonderful video, remember to turn on the small bell ðŸ””

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,900
What are you waiting for. Why don't you read it before you talk!

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Friendly reminder: If you are voice control, face control, please do not watch this video

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,700
You are not welcome here, and you will not like me, bye ðŸ‘‹

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,200
In the past two years, the old Gao Na broke the channel quite a bit, let's take advantage of it

17
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,100
Talk about this old celebrity

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:08,100
Rest assured, let's beep softly, he can't hear it, hahaha

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,500
To be honest I used to be a big fan of Lao Gao Channel

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,100
I remember when he watched his video for the first time, his channel only had 400,000 subscriptions

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,700
I just saw the urban legends he talked about was very attractive

22
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,800
So I watched his channel all the time, but there are some flaws

23
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,000
The subtitles are black background and traditional characters, which is particularly annoying, but the flaws are not concealed

24
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,100
For me, I think there are quite a lot of channels for storytelling

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,400
There must be a lot of talks better than him

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:39,900
I searched many times, even if there are more fans than him, itâ€™s not as good as what he said

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,200
The level spoken by others is too low, or you will not be interested after a while

28
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,500
Although they all talk about the same subject, but he is good

29
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,000
The story he tells, I just want to read it all at once

30
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,600
Even, after reading it, I want to read it again.

31
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,500
Every time I release a new video, I open the tubing in advance and wait, I am very excited

32
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,900
I'm more excited than waiting for animation

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,400
But the good times are not long, and one day my impression of him suddenly changed

34
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
When did I hate Lao Gao?

35
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,800
Previously he published a video about drilling through the earth

36
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,200
I saw a very similar video not long ago

37
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,500
Iâ€™m not interested in that channel, I accidentally subscribed, I didnâ€™t see it

38
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,000
The lines spoken by Lao Gao are almost the same

39
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,200
In addition to the material changed. To put it bluntly, I suspect he plagiarized

40
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,100
It can be understood if the cited materials are the same

41
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,900
But his materials are different, others are willing to spend money to buy materials

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,400
The key is that the logical sequence of explanation is almost the same

43
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,400
The release date is several days later than that video, what else can I think about

44
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,100
Of course, this is a trivial matter

45
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,500
Countless bloggers on the same subject are grabbing traffic

46
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,900
You have to collect information when you shoot a video, no matter what search engine you use

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,400
The results found are all ranked high in the fire

48
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,300
To put it bluntly, the information you found is almost the same, even the same

49
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,000
By the way, Baidu Encyclopedia has been copying Wikipedia

50
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:03,100
After the copying, the Baidu trademark was marked underneath, which seemed to be copyright-conscious, and claimed that Wikipedia copied him

51
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,800
The mainland likes to engage in second-hand materials, finished, cracked or something

52
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,700
How do you judge plagiarism?

53
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,900
Look at the release date and repetition rate, just like the paper review, use the data to speak

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,600
But I didn't find any suitable program to analyze

55
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:22,800
Seeing from the surface, 70% of Lao Gaoâ€™s video is the same as a certain channelâ€™s video

56
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,700
And the video is a Chinese-language version of English popular science, is it good for Lao Gao English?

57
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,500
Will he choose English materials or second-hand Chinese materials? Who knows?

58
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,800
Of course, this is a trivial matter. I didnâ€™t even worry about it.

59
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,000
Later, several videos were the same, I was a little bit bored

60
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,400
However, I am reluctant to cancel attention, do you think I am the kind of careful eye?

61
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,500
I think he will definitely produce more exciting videos

62
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,500
Wait, wait, until one day, he published a video

63
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,800
Say: "The most amazing planet in the world: Earth"

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,500
I was directly angry: what is there to say, are you doing primary school science?

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,700
It's too boring. Get it directly, never read it again

66
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,000
Can you just tell your urban legend?

67
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,700
You have to copy someone else, except to show off the video material you bought from shuttlestock

68
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Is there anything else? There is also an old lady who has been sitting there laughing

69
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,500
A very ordinary teddy dog

70
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,700
He said he looked up when he couldn't move. When will this old terrier talk about it?

71
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,500
Isnâ€™t it that Lao Gao said the wrong thing casually, did the old lady smile?

72
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,500
Aunt Bo smiled and looked up from now on

73
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,400
I also engaged in a "heads-up group", which collects IQ tax

74
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,300
I'm not against him making money, but this is really boring

75
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,200
I think his way of showing off the video material is equivalent to saying to me:

76
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,700
I bought a block watch, can you afford it?

77
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,600
I just saw what he meant. I donâ€™t know if I misunderstood

78
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,000
If you feel that his video material is tall, you may not see the essence and think so much

79
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:51,500
If you think Iâ€™m jealous of him, and you still have a bit of a hatred for riches, then you also misunderstood

80
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,200
I just became a knowledge channel because his channel style changed

81
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,900
It's too boring, it's boring. Don't want to watch

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,300
Knowledge channel is just a good name, I prefer to call it popular science

83
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,200
Because itâ€™s really something you can find with just a search, at your fingertips

84
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,600
He said as if he knew it alone

85
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,200
You want elementary school students to come to your channel to learn knowledge, so you donâ€™t have to read the encyclopedia, right?

86
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,600
What can you learn from your channel? Your new material? Itâ€™s $10, so itâ€™s rich

87
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,600
If the occasional water video is occasionally, I can understand, but it is still water video every Monday

88
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,600
I can't understand it. Maybe itâ€™s just me who feels water, so Iâ€™m out of the group

89
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,600
I am a complete fan of passers-by

90
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,400
Lao Gao began to embark on the cottage route, without his own ideas and opinions

91
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,700
All the information searched by Google, at your fingertips

92
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,700
However, he also has his own characteristics, that is willing to spend money to buy materials

93
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,200
Because ordinary local tyrants donâ€™t spend money on video footage

94
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,800
They are showing off luxury cars

95
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,200
Lao Gao is about the same, even if there is no luxury car mansion, there is a small car house.

96
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,700
The material he buys is one of his main ways to show off wealth

97
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,200
The poor people canâ€™t use these materials, the rich people canâ€™t use them.

98
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,500
He happened to be stuck in the middle, and things are rare

99
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,300
I am asking for food, but I am original, no plagiarism or imitation

100
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,900
There is no ostentation or disguise, just some objective facts and subjective evaluation

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,700
I just made some personal remarks

102
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,600
There is no malicious defamation of others, nor personal attacks, at most it is a suggestion

103
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,300
I think someone will say in your heart: Are you qualified to comment on others? How old are you?

104
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,200
Why am I not qualified to comment? Anyone has freedom of speech

105
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,600
I have to defend the rights of citizens

106
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:29,400
Itâ€™s just that most people like it, and a few people step on it. This is normal.

107
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,800
Do you buy things first by watching the bad reviews buyer show? Or do you want to watch the five-star favorable buyer show first?

108
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,700
Think about it yourself, but the five-star reviews are all on the top, which is good for the seller, right?

109
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,500
Itâ€™s important to keep my own thoughts and opinions, Iâ€™m not a person who follows the crowd

110
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,700
If you think what I said makes sense, please like it

111
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,400
If you think Iâ€™m talking nonsense, please click on it

112
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,400
Everyone has free choice

113
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,500
I think not many people dare to say the second half of this sentence

114
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,500
What do you usually say: like it quickly, subscribe now, press the bell

115
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm not like other people, if you don't like it, just step on it

116
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,900
Your valuable opinions are also my motivation

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,400
Unlike mainland social software, only likes and does not dislike

118
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,800
I admit that my evaluation of Lao Gao is partial

119
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,600
But this kind of bias is all right, because this is not a minor bias, at least 40%

120
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,000
Itâ€™s like being alone in your impression

121
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,100
But he did something that you hated

122
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
After a long time, you hate him

123
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,100
Even if he changes back, you may not forgive. This is human nature

124
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,000
To be sure, if Lao Gaoâ€™s fans saw my video

125
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,500
It is very likely to spit me and even scold me

126
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,200
But most of the people who scolded me were stupid fans because he lacked the ability to think rationally

127
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,900
You may think that the small questions I said are overkill, a bit excessive, and even suspected of having card keywords

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,100
With the high popularity of the old, grab the traffic

129
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,300
The first half of the sentence is wrong, not too much, to be honest

130
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,600
If you like to watch urban legends, the main channel will become the science of primary school students

131
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,700
Also known as the Knowledge Channel, would you still follow him?

132
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,400
The second half of the sentence is correct, I took advantage of him a little hot, grabbed traffic

133
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,600
Who doesn't want to fire?

134
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,400
Of course, I didnâ€™t mean to say something against the flow intentionally

135
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,000
I really want to vomit, but just happened to vomit a celebrity

136
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,400
Someone may not watch it yet

137
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,800
I feel that many fans of his channel donâ€™t know what they want?

138
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,800
What does that mean?

139
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,300
He didnâ€™t know what video he was interested in, it was purely what others said

140
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,700
To put it bluntly, I came to join the lively crowd of melons

141
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,700
For example, a bunch of people in the chat area commented on how to look forward to this video

142
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,800
He wasnâ€™t interested, but he couldnâ€™t help but exaggerate two words

143
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,600
Thus forming the domino effect

144
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,600
This is similar to the dark ages of Europe in the Middle Ages, such as a plague in an area

145
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,200
The locals are not looking for doctors, but for wizards to exorcise

146
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:44,600
Seeing who doesnâ€™t like it, the wizard said he was a demon, but the people underneath didnâ€™t know it.

147
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,000
Completely lost self-judgment

148
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,200
But the wizard has a appeal, he will say: burn him, the plague will be gone

149
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,100
The people underneath follow public opinion, as long as someone calls him to death

150
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,900
Almost everyone will shout: burn him to death

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,700
There are often a few people who stand up and say that this person is not a demon, he is innocent

152
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,700
You are confusing

153
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,200
And honest people are often burned to death

154
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,300
I think the person corresponding to the character in this story should be able to get the right seat

155
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,200
The plague is the barrage of the chat area, and the wizard is Lao Gao

156
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,600
The story he told is: burn him to death, the plague is gone

157
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,500
You are the people underneath, shouting and burning him together. I am the one who stands up to tell the truth

158
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,000
Lao Gao is in the financial industry, he said it himself, it sounds like an executive

159
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,200
Checked Wikipedia, he is a financial IT consultant, sounds tall

160
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,800
To put it bluntly, isn't it just a technical promotion?

161
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,500
No wonder they are fooling people, how can they sell their own products without talking

162
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,200
Who still buys his company's stock?

163
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,600
He doesn't pretend to talk a little, how can he appear to be so good?

164
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,700
I have heard a pretend sentence: Well, sometimes I need to do some subtraction

165
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,600
He wanted to say: This famous brand bag is old and can be thrown away

166
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,600
It can be a moral kidnapping to be a fan of Lao Gao

167
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,800
You may not understand what I am saying?

168
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,600
For example, helpfulness is a virtue, which sounds right

169
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,600
But in some cases itâ€™s moral kidnapping

170
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,500
I am obviously not willing to help you, but on some occasions

171
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,000
But you said why don't you help me. You are forcing me to help you

172
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,300
I can choose to refuse, but if I donâ€™t help you, it seems impersonal

173
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,200
Helping or not helping is very tiring, this is moral abduction

174
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,600
Bridge bean sack

175
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,300
Chotto Matteyo

176
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,200
Sorry, I said it was off topic, it has nothing to do with moral kidnapping

177
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,300
It's purely voluntary behavior, I just revitalize the atmosphere, just warm the field

178
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,400
How is it cold? I came here to warm up without wearing trousers

179
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Having said that, knowledge channels are now easier to fire.

180
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,700
This is also a reason for the transformation of the old high channel

181
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,500
The one that has been more successful is the "yellow bulb" channel, which has nearly 40 million subscriptions.

182
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,300
There is also a "simply put", almost 13 million fans

183
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
So you see Lao Gao's ambitions?

184
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,400
I'm not a fan of him now, I will give him a step on it, go on

185
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,800
Because modern people use search engines to check information every day, they can meet the needs of daily life

186
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,500
Most of the searched are Wikipedia and scientific papers, using a lot of professional terminology

187
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,500
Very scientific and rigorous, but it seems more strenuous

188
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,600
If the search does not use regular expressions, it is easier to find some non-nutritive water stickers

189
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,300
The cost of time is higher

190
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,900
This gives business opportunities to those who prefer to read boring papers

191
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,300
You donâ€™t like to watch it, he likes to watch it, after finishing it, he organizes it into a video and sends it to you

192
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,800
Is this a wit? Is it treacherous? See the difference

193
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,500
I am now less and less interested in knowledge channels, because I am old

194
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,300
Iâ€™m talking about mental age, Iâ€™m in my early 20s

195
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,300
[Oh, I lost my hair in my early 20s, it looks like my early 30s]

196
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,000
[If itâ€™s really in its early 30s, wouldnâ€™t it be Mediterranean? . . ] Who! Who is talking about me

197
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,800
Now I face boring academic papers, but my heart is still very resistant

198
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,200
But I can see it in.

199
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,800
Because the data sources like these knowledge channels are not formal for these boring things?

200
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,100
Are boring in nature

201
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,200
I just packed it and changed it.

202
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,500
Just like what is the difference between me and a dog?

203
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,000
There is no difference in essence [dong]

204
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,700
We are all one nose and two eyes, we can run and jump and weep

205
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,700
You have to eat, drink, and sleep, all are mammals

206
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,400
If you canâ€™t understand it, thatâ€™s okay, anyway, I canâ€™t understand my thoughts.

207
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,200
A person like you is no different than me

208
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,600
Essentially the same

209
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,200
[Dong]

210
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,800
[Tongue out]

211
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,300
Lao Gao's channel I predict that it will be replaced by AI in 5 years

212
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,200
The inspiration for this sentence is that I deliberately plagiarized him, in order to show you something

213
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,400
At present, AI under technology is more blown out, not so god

214
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,300
I believe that most people think that the current AI is at most artificially mentally retarded

215
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,100
For example, Googleâ€™s previous face recognition

216
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,100
Recognized black girlfriends as gorillas and organized photo albums

217
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,900
Microsoft's previously developed AI voice assistant

218
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,600
Originally warm and friendly, it was broken by many people during the open beta

219
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,600
It became swearing, racial discrimination, very yellow and violent

220
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:53,900
Needless to say, those on the mainland are blowing into the sky, and the cottage is not worthy of being vomited by me

221
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,800
Of course it shouldnâ€™t be too small

222
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,900
For example, the manipulators worn by the disabled can be controlled with consciousness

223
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,900
Looks like a real human hand, itâ€™s amazing

224
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,500
But it is still artificially mentally retarded, and there is still a long way to go from the AI â€‹â€‹of Zhenger

225
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,200
When it comes to AI, you might think of quantum computers

226
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:15,100
All are cutting-edge technologies. I hate people who talk about quantum when they talk about entanglement

227
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,000
You know wool, you are entangled. Too pretending, too disgusting

228
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:26,500
The most nonsense is quantum health, quantum series of daily necessities, quantum training classes

229
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,600
Itâ€™s not a shame. Those who deceive those who eat melons really deserve to eat melons.

230
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,800
There is a reason why Lao Gao will be replaced by AI

231
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:37,700
Because you need to check the information for the video, and then say it after finishing

232
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
This is equivalent to text to speech

233
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:44,700
If you cooperate with the host 3D model, plus the AI â€‹â€‹program to crawl the data and organize the data

234
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,900
Then give the youtuber background to the AI â€‹â€‹program control

235
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,600
Then you can fully synthesize and publish the video

236
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,700
This is similar to the job of a live youtuber and saves time

237
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,500
Now it is actually possible to synthesize this kind of video, but the effect is too bad, too fake

238
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,700
There is no emotion, but there are many fans

239
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,100
If future quantum computers can synthesize real human emotions

240
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,500
The 3D model in the video will be more perfect than the live YouTuber

241
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,400
After vomiting, he should praise him. What are the aspects of Lao Gao?

242
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,000
For example, fans have high viscosity, like Pewdiepie

243
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,000
Lao Gao's newly released video fans have the highest viewing rate in a day

244
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,800
There are basically as many fans as there are fans. To put it plainly, it's basically hardcore powder

245
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,600
Pewdiepie has over 100 million followers, but few fans

246
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,200
His newly released videos often have less than 5 million daily views

247
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,600
Frankly speaking, there are a lot of passers-by

248
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,800
From my point of view, I would rather just have a hardcore fan

249
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,100
Donâ€™t need 100 passerby fans, let alone zombie fans

250
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:49,100
In addition, Lao Gao is also very interactive, often using some cohesive terms like a storyteller

251
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,800
What is the storyline of the storyteller: As mentioned in the previous book, bulabulabula

252
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,400
To know what happened next, letâ€™s break it down next time

253
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,900
Don't underestimate these two lines, it is enough to arouse the curiosity of many audiences

254
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,700
This is very helpful for sucking powder and increasing viewing volume

255
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,500
He also learned it. I boast that his two sentences are purely objective facts, and they have no meaning of passing people by.

256
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,100
If you have any unpleasant people or things, please leave a message below

257
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,000
I'll help you scold him, I scold people who never carry dirty words

258
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,500
Of course you are responsible for the accident, I pay for dinner

259
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:27,800
Hahaha...

260
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,500
[Beatbox]

261
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,700
If you like my video, remember to like, comment, share, and turn on the small bell by the way!

262
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,600
See you next time! Bye bye
